FumoKit is a custom Python-powered Discord bot built specifically for our server. Originally created as a fun personal project, it has grown into a versatile assistant that automates tasks, manages roles, and posts announcements. With the latest update, FumoKit now features AI integration powered by Llama 3.2, allowing it to generate intelligent, interactive, and context-aware responses right inside Discord.
